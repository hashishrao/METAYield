> 💳 Let your **crypto yield** repay your **credit card bills** — automatically, intelligently, and onchain.

## 🚀 About the Project

**MetaYield** is an AI-powered auto-repayment dashboard built for **MetaMask Card** users. It takes your idle, staked crypto and turns it into a self-repaying financial system. Just connect your wallet, define your spending, and let the AI do the rest. 

Built for real-world financial efficiency, MetaYield bridges DeFi yields (from **Aave**, **Compound**, and more) with **Circle’s USDC**, turning passive income into real-time USDC credit card repayments.

> ✨ Designed for humans. Powered by crypto. Controlled by AI.

🧠 Inspiration

We asked: Why can’t your crypto income handle your real-world bills?

MetaYield was born out of this frustration — and the belief that finance should work for you, not against you. Built during the MetaMask Card Dev Cook-Off Hackathon, MetaYield is a glimpse into a world where Web3 and TradFi merge seamlessly.
